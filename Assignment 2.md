## &nbsp;			 Section 4: Practical Application





&nbsp;	**10. Demonstrate how to replace a CPU fan in a desktop computer.** 

&nbsp;	ans :-step 1 - power off :-shutdown your computer and unplug the power cord and hold the power button for few seconds 

&nbsp;                          to discharge any electricity.



&nbsp;       step 2 - Open the Case :- Remove the side panel to access the CPU area.



&nbsp;       step 3 - Locate the CPU fan :- The CPU fan is usually located on top of the CPU which is covered by heatsink.



&nbsp;       step 4 - Disconnect the fan :- Disconnect the fan's power cable from the motherboard.

&nbsp;                                 :- It will be a small 3 or 4-pin connector labeled "CPU FAN".



&nbsp;      step 5 - Remove the old fan:- Carefully detach the fan from the heatsink.



&nbsp;      step 6 - Clean the CPU :- Use a lint-free cloth and isopropyl alcoholto remove any old

&nbsp;                               thermal paste from the top of the CPU and the bottom of the heatsink. 

&nbsp;     

&nbsp;      step-7 - Apply new thermal paste :- apply the small size of new thermal to the center of CPU.



&nbsp;      step 8 - install the new fan cooler :- Secure the new fan to the heatsink, ensuring it's properly aligned and making good contact.



&nbsp;      step 9 - Reconnect the fan :- Connect the new fan's power cable to the CPU fan on the motherboard.

&nbsp;    

&nbsp;      step 10 - Close the case :- Close the computer case,

&nbsp;                                 and again power on your computer,

&nbsp;                                 and check the new fan is working correctly,

&nbsp;                                 you can see the CPU tempraturen in the BIOS.
